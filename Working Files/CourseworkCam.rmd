# Some YAML Stuff

The lion's share of a R Markdown document will be raw text, though the front matter may be the most important part of the document. R Markdown uses [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) for its metadata and the fields differ from [what an author would use for a Beamer presentation](http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/02/moving-from-beamer-to-r-markdown/). I provide a sample YAML metadata largely taken from this exact document and explain it below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
output: 
  pdf_document:
    keep_tex: true
    fig_caption: true
    latex_engine: pdflatex
title: "A Pandoc Markdown Article Starter and Template"
abstract: "This document provides an introduction to R Markdown, argues for its..."
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')`"
geometry: margin=1in
fontsize: 11pt
# spacing: double
---
```

`output:` will tell R Markdown we want a PDF document rendered with LaTeX. Since we are adding a fair bit of custom options to this call, we specify `pdf_document:` on the next line (with, importantly, a two-space indent). We specify additional output-level options underneath it, each are indented with four spaces. The line (`keep_tex: true`) tells R Markdown to render a raw `.tex` file along with the PDF document. This is useful for both debugging and the publication stage. The next line `fig_caption: true` tells R Markdown to make sure that whatever images are included in the document are treated as figures in which our caption in brackets in a Markdown call is treated as the caption in the figure. The next line (`latex_engine: pdflatex`) tells R Markdown to use pdflatex and not some other option like `lualatex`. For this template, I'm pretty sure this is mandatory.[^pdflatex]

The next fields get to the heart of the document itself. `title:` is, intuitively, the title of the manuscript. Do note that fields like `title:` do not have to be in quotation marks, but must be in quotation marks if the title of the document includes a colon. That said, the only reason to use a colon in an article title is if it is followed by a subtitle, hence the optional field (`subtitle:`). Notice I "comment out" the subtitle in the above example with a pound sign since this particular document does not have a subtitle.

`date` comes standard with R Markdown and you can use it to enter the date of the most recent compile.

The next items are optional and cosmetic. `geometry:` is a standard option in LaTeX. I set the margins at one inch, and you probably should too. `fontsize:` sets, intuitively, the font size. The default is 10-point, but I prefer 11-point. `spacing:` is an optional field. If it is set as "double", the ensuing document is double-spaced. "single" is the only other valid entry for this field, though not including the entry in the YAML metadata amounts to singlespacing the document by default. Notice I have this "commented out" in the example code.

# Getting Started with Markdown Syntax

There are a lot of cheatsheets and reference guides for Markdown (e.g. [Adam Prichard](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), [Assemble](http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html), [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf), [Rstudio again](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf), [Scott Boms](http://scottboms.com/downloads/documentation/markdown_cheatsheet.pdf), [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), among, I'm sure, several others).

# Introduction

**Lorem ipsum** dolor *sit amet*. 

- Single asterisks italicize text *like this*. 
- Double asterisks embolden text **like this**.

Start a new paragraph with a blank line separating paragraphs.

- This will start an unordered list environment, and this will be the first item.
- This will be a second item.
- A third item.
    - Four spaces and a dash create a sublist and this item in it.
- The fourth item.
    
1. This starts a numerical list.
2. This is no. 2 in the numerical list.
    
# This Starts A New Section
## This is a Subsection
### This is a Subsubsection
#### This starts a Paragraph Block.

> This will create a block quote, if you want one.

Want a table? This will create one.

Table Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Table Cell    | Cell 2
Cell 3        | Cell 4 

Note that the separators *do not* have to be aligned.

Want an image? This will do it.

![caption for my image](path/to/image.jpg)

`fig_caption: yes` will provide a caption. Put that in the YAML metadata.

Almost forgot about creating a footnote.[^1] This will do it again.[^2]

[^1]: The first footnote
[^2]: The second footnote

Want to cite something? 

- Find your biblatexkey in your bib file.
- Put an @ before it, like @smith1984, or whatever it is.
- @smith1984 creates an in-text citation (e.g. Smith (1984) says...)
- [@smith1984] creates a parenthetical citation (Smith, 1984)

That'll also automatically create a reference list at the end of the document.

[In-text link to Google](http://google.com) as well.

## Exploring the Data

### Checking for Messy Data

```{r LoadDataset}
library(haven) # Required to present the summary of labelled data.
load("~/MA30091/Coursework/MA30091/Datasets/hsesub.Rdata") # The dset is called subdat
summary(subdat)
```
This tells us that all of our variables are coded as numeric. However, we may want to code some as factor variables instead based on the variable descriptions.

Note that the null flavors may not be used for modeling (and can just be treated as generic missing values), but they will bve useful for evaluating the study design. For example, lots of **Refused** for a variable could mean there is a bias in porivacy or that the question is too sensitive. Lots of **Don't know** for a variable could indicate some recall bias and that the question is poorly designed, whereas lots of **Not applicable** either comes from reduced generalisability (e.g. "Is patient currently pregnant?) or poorly measured variables (Like valid BMI results being sparse due to bad measurements or missing heights/weights).

The variable d7many3_19 has nothing but missing values, so this variable can be dropped from analysis.
