#Mean across age groups for smoking, drinking (often), vaping (By gender) (% which do smoking, e-cig, frequent alcohol)

#We see from QQ plot that a transformation may be useful. I suspect one on the drinks per week could make sense as it is distinctly a non linear growth.


#Can see in final graph there are some very high leverage outliers which might be worth investigating

#Overall can notice the positive interaction effect between age and smoking; Moreover, as we would expect (note our baseline is frequent drinkers) the less you drink the lower the blood pressure.
