# Some YAML Stuff

The lion's share of a R Markdown document will be raw text, though the front matter may be the most important part of the document. R Markdown uses [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) for its metadata and the fields differ from [what an author would use for a Beamer presentation](http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/02/moving-from-beamer-to-r-markdown/). I provide a sample YAML metadata largely taken from this exact document and explain it below.

```{r eval=FALSE}

  pdf_document:
    keep_tex: true
    fig_caption: true
    latex_engine: pdflatex

```

`output:` will tell R Markdown we want a PDF document rendered with LaTeX. Since we are adding a fair bit of custom options to this call, we specify `pdf_document:` on the next line (with, importantly, a two-space indent). We specify additional output-level options underneath it, each are indented with four spaces. The line (`keep_tex: true`) tells R Markdown to render a raw `.tex` file along with the PDF document. This is useful for both debugging and the publication stage. The next line `fig_caption: true` tells R Markdown to make sure that whatever images are included in the document are treated as figures in which our caption in brackets in a Markdown call is treated as the caption in the figure. The next line (`latex_engine: pdflatex`) tells R Markdown to use pdflatex and not some other option like `lualatex`. For this template, I'm pretty sure this is mandatory.[^pdflatex]

The next fields get to the heart of the document itself. `title:` is, intuitively, the title of the manuscript. Do note that fields like `title:` do not have to be in quotation marks, but must be in quotation marks if the title of the document includes a colon. That said, the only reason to use a colon in an article title is if it is followed by a subtitle, hence the optional field (`subtitle:`). Notice I "comment out" the subtitle in the above example with a pound sign since this particular document does not have a subtitle.

`date` comes standard with R Markdown and you can use it to enter the date of the most recent compile.

The next items are optional and cosmetic. `geometry:` is a standard option in LaTeX. I set the margins at one inch, and you probably should too. `fontsize:` sets, intuitively, the font size. The default is 10-point, but I prefer 11-point. `spacing:` is an optional field. If it is set as "double", the ensuing document is double-spaced. "single" is the only other valid entry for this field, though not including the entry in the YAML metadata amounts to singlespacing the document by default. Notice I have this "commented out" in the example code.

# Getting Started with Markdown Syntax

There are a lot of cheatsheets and reference guides for Markdown (e.g. [Adam Prichard](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), [Assemble](http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html), [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf), [Rstudio again](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf), [Scott Boms](http://scottboms.com/downloads/documentation/markdown_cheatsheet.pdf), [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), among, I'm sure, several others).

# Introduction

**Lorem ipsum** dolor *sit amet*. 

- Single asterisks italicize text *like this*. 
- Double asterisks embolden text **like this**.

Start a new paragraph with a blank line separating paragraphs.

- This will start an unordered list environment, and this will be the first item.
- This will be a second item.
- A third item.
    - Four spaces and a dash create a sublist and this item in it.
- The fourth item.
    
1. This starts a numerical list.
2. This is no. 2 in the numerical list.
    
# This Starts A New Section
## This is a Subsection
### This is a Subsubsection
#### This starts a Paragraph Block.

> This will create a block quote, if you want one.

Want a table? This will create one.

Table Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Table Cell    | Cell 2
Cell 3        | Cell 4 

Note that the separators *do not* have to be aligned.

Want an image? This will do it.

![caption for my image](path/to/image.jpg)

`fig_caption: yes` will provide a caption. Put that in the YAML metadata.

Almost forgot about creating a footnote.[^1] This will do it again.[^2]

[^1]: The first footnote
[^2]: The second footnote

Want to cite something? 

- Find your biblatexkey in your bib file.
- Put an @ before it, like @smith1984, or whatever it is.
- @smith1984 creates an in-text citation (e.g. Smith (1984) says...)
- [@smith1984] creates a parenthetical citation (Smith, 1984)

That'll also automatically create a reference list at the end of the document.

[In-text link to Google](http://google.com) as well.
