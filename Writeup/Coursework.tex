This report provides an analysis of data related to health, age,
socio-economic factors and lifestyle habits in adults (from the age of
16) from the population in England, derived from the Health Survey for
England 2019. Please note, no generative AI technology was utilized in
the creation of this report or the subsequent data analysis presented
herein. All findings and conclusions are derived from human-driven
methodologies.

\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

In England, smoking, ``vaping'' and alcohol consumption are widespread
habits among adults, particularly younger adults. In fact, it is
estimated that around 13.9\% of adults in England identified as
cigarette smokers (\protect\hyperlink{ref-1ONS}{ONS 2019a}), and a
similar study found that there were 10.9 alcohol-related deaths per
100,000 people living in England in 2019
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-2ONS}{ONS 2019c}). Thus, it is crucial to be
aware of the predictors and consequences of these habits, which is the
motivation for this analysis.

We conducted this analysis on a subset containing 8,204 adults living in
England (ages 16+), who were interviewed in their homes about their
demographics and their smoking and drinking habits as part of the Health
Survey for England (HSE) 2019. 4,947 of these participants who consented
to an at-home nurse visit had vitals such as blood pressure, weight and
height measured. We investigated which features of a participant are
associated with smoking habits, and which habits are associated with
high blood pressure.

We found alcohol consumption to be the most prevalent lifestyle habit
under investigation. Older males were found to drink the most,
especially those aged 65-74. Also, smoking tended to be more prevalent
in areas of greater deprivation, whilst alcohol consumption was found to
be more prevalent in less deprived areas. Socio-economic factors played
an important role in the likelihood of smoking, with females 25\% less
likely to be smokers than males. Ethnicity also played a great role, as
being Black or Asian decreased the likelihood of smoking by more than
70\% and 65\%, respectively. Females were much less likely to experience
hypertension in comparison to males. However, systolic blood pressure
levels were positively correlated with age and how often the respondent
drinks alcohol, regardless of gender.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The mechanisms which drive lifestyle habits are part of a complex and
ever-changing field in behavioural psychology. What is known, however,
is that such habits are driven by cues and cravings
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-SmokeCue}{Anastasia Droungas 1995};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-DrinkCue}{Kambouropoulos 2009}). The HSE 2019
captures demographic and socioeconomic characteristics that have the
potential to make such cues more visible and cravings harder to resist.
For example, living in a region where smoking is more prevalent or not
having a husband/wife for an accountability partner to help you quit or
resist these habits (\protect\hyperlink{ref-AccountPartner}{ONS 2019b}).

In this report, we will use weighting variables to estimate prevalence
of cigarette, e-cig, and alcohol users in our population, and compare it
with the larger population of adults in England. We will then attempt to
identify associations with a participant's current smoking status,
explore whether predictive modelling can be used to identify smokers
with a high accuracy, and investigate which lifestyle habits are
associated with increased values of systolic blood pressure. Such an
understanding would be crucial in enabling healthcare providers to
implement preventative care for people at risk of developing
hypertension.

\subsection{Exploratory Analysis}\label{exploratory-analysis}}

The full HSE 2019 cross-sectional data set contains 10,299 observations
across thousands of variables (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Main}{NatCen
Social Research and Health 2019}), but we only studied patients over the
age of 16 among key variables. Our subset included 8,204 participants
and 19 variables, which are described in Table
\ref{tab:output-var-table}.

\hypertarget{duplicates}{%
\subsubsection{Duplicates}\label{duplicates}}

We found 36 pairs of observations with exactly equal variables
(excluding ID variables and lab measurements), but we did not remove
these from our analysis because the supporting documentation didn't
state a protocol for repeated visits. We assumed these were genuine
observations from different participants and thus included them in our
dataset. However, there were 3 pairs of observations that had duplicate
lab variables also. Due to the high precision of measurements, we
believed these to be true duplicates and removed one observation from
each of the three pairs, resulting in a dataset of 8201 observations.

\hypertarget{dichotomy-of-factors}{%
\subsubsection{Dichotomy of Factors}\label{dichotomy-of-factors}}

All variables were originally coded as numeric in our dataset, so we
recoded these to factor variables accordingly. Some of the variables
used for analysis were dichotomised by us for easier interpretation. We
coded a binary variable indicating current smoking status, which served
as a response variable. Also, we dichotomised urbanity into two levels
being `Rural' and `Urban', and finally marital status into `Married' and
`Not Married'. We grouped respondent's level of education into `Higher
Education', `Further Education', `A-Level equiv.', `GCSE equiv.', `No
qualification' and `Foreign/other', and we grouped alcohol frequency
into ``Frequent'', ``Occasional'' and ``Rarely'' based on the response
to the question ``How often did you consume alcohol in the last 12
months?''.

\hypertarget{missingness}{%

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

There is significant missingness in the lab values, as shown in Table
\ref{tab:output-na-table}. These can be explained by the fact additional
consent was needed from the participant to allow a nurse visit. One
variable with a substantial amount of missing data was the frequency of
drinking in the last 12 months, which due to the retrospective and
sensitive nature of the question could be explained by either recall
bias or a participant's refusal to answer. As a result, we decided to
remove this variable from analysis in favour of a binary variable which
simply states whether the respondent has drunk alcohol in the last 12
months. Education level, marital status and ethnicity are the only
socioeconomic variables with any missing entries, with 46 observations
(0.701\% of the data) missing at least one of the three. These were not
necessary for identifiability and as they are sensitive, we did not
expect every participant to answer these questions. Therefore, we did
not remove these observations.

\hypertarget{outliers-and-data-issues}{%
\subsubsection{Outliers and Data
Issues}\label{outliers-and-data-issues}}

We attempted to determine whether the two lab measurement variables
contained potential outliers, and as can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:output-distribution-plots}, there were many outliers for BMI.
We note that calculated BMI used self-estimated weight from the
participant if this weight exceeded 130kg. Additionally, weight
measurements were taken in inconsistent environments such as on
different flooring in the participants' homes which is known to impact
measurement accuracy (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Weight}{Scientist 2002}).
We believed this could have explained the extremely high BMI values in
the range of 54.82 to 73.49. We coded such values as missing in the
analysis dataset, but kept the observation.

The readings for systolic blood pressure were collected by taking an
average of three readings, each five minutes apart, performed by a
trained nurse who had to declare each reading to be valid. For this
reason, it seemed highly unlikely that these readings were mistakes, and
so we included them in our analysis. The measurement device used has
been validated for use in this environment
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Omron}{Yechiam Ostchega PhD 2009}). We did,
however, note that values of systolic blood pressure that were this
consistently high (\textgreater140mmHg) were indicators for hypertensive
crisis, and so a part of our population may have serious underlying
health conditions that could affect the generalisability of our findings
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-heart}{Association 2023}).

\subsubsection{What is the prevelence of drinking, smoking and E-cig
usage?}\label{what-is-the-prevelence-of-drinking-smoking-and-e-cig-usage}}

To calculate the prevalence of these three habits we assumed each of the
\(n\) observations, \(x_1,…,x_n\) , to be independent, identically
distributed (iid) random variables (RVs) where
\(x_i \sim Bern(p)\, \forall i=1,…,n\) and \(p\) denotes the probability
of a habit being present for the given observation.

We used the household-level weighting variable to calculate a weighted
Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of \(p\). That is, letting \(w_i\)
denote the weight of the \(i^{th}\) observation, we altered the standard
likelihood function of a Bernoulli distribution as below:
\[L(p|\textbf{x}) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} (p^{x_i}(1-p)^{1-x_i})^{w_i}\]
From this, we calculated our weighted MLE as
\(\widehat{p} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iw_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}\). It
can also be shown that the MLE has variance given by
\(\text{var}(p)=\frac{p(1-p)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i}\), which we estimated
using \(\widehat{p}\). We used large sample properties of the MLE to get
a normal approximation and estimated 95\% confidence intervals for each
habit, which are shown in Table \ref{tab:output-estimates-table}.

\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We found that the e-cigarette usage among adults is relatively low,
making it challenging to dissect any significant trends within the data.
However, since drinking and smoking were so prevalent among the
respondents, we had sufficient data to identify any potential trends
even within smaller groups of our sample.

Next, we worked to uncover factors that may have associations with
smoking prevalence. We started with the demographic factors of age and
gender, plotting the smoking prevalence across combinations of these
groups to identify any patterns. Figure \ref{fig:output-prevelance-plot}
suggests a negative correlation between age and the proportion of
current cigarette smokers, across both genders. Interestingly, the
proportion of males who quit smoking in later-life was much greater than
that of females (75yrs+; M: 50\%, F: 31\%).

\includegraphics{Coursework_files/figure-latex/output-prevelance-plot-1} \caption{Estimation of the prevelance of habits by age group and gender.}\label{fig:output-prevelance-plot}
\end{figure}

Males demonstrated a higher prevalence of drinking across nearly all
demographic categories in comparison to females. We observed a positive
correlation between smoking and deprivation levels, with 25.76\% of
individuals in the most deprived quintile being smokers, a significant
increase from 9.33\% in the least deprived.

We reserved 80\% of our data to train the model, and used the remaining
20\% to test the model, which was made possible due to the large size of
our dataset. The training set contained 6561 observations and the test
set contained 1640. Table \ref{tab:output-testtrain-table} summarises
the key variables between the test and train dataset to illustrate that
both are representative of the whole dataset. This reduced the risk of
overfitting and allowed us to test the predictive power of each model we
proposed.

To develop a predictive model for identifying smokers, we used the
binary variable for current smoking status as a response, with various
socioeconomic and demographic factors as predictors. These were selected
based on the associations suggested by our prior analysis.

Under the assumption that the age of participants were approximately
uniformly distributed within their respective age bands, we defined the
estimated age of the \(i^{th}\) observation as the midpoint of the
participant's respective 5-year age group (taking the estimation of the
90+ category as 92.5), denoted \(a_i\). We found that age may represent
a somewhat quadratic effect on the probability of smoking, leading us to
include a \(a_i^2\) term in our model. A comparison of these models are
summarised in Table \ref{tab:output-model-selection-table}.

We selected the model based on AIC, which enabled us to balance model
complexity and model fit (quantified by likelihood), which further
reduced the risk of overfitting. This model is: \begin{align*}
\text{logit}(\mu_i) \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1a + \beta_2a^2 + \beta_3q + \alpha^{ms}_j + \alpha^{u}_k + \alpha^{o}_l + \alpha^{t}_m + \alpha^{s}_n \\\text{where } j \in \{\text{Married, Not Married}\}, k \in \{\text{Urban, Not Urban}\},\\ l \in \{\text{White,}\ldots\text{,Black}\}, n \in \{\text{Male, Female\} and}\ \\ m \in \{\text{Higher Education,}\ldots\text{, No qualification}\}.
\end{align*}

To evaluate the predictive performance of our final model using our test
data, Figure 4 demonstrates the predicted probability of each
`probability bin' against the mean actual outcomes. As we can see the
calibration curve closely follows the line \(y = x\), which is
indicative of a well-calibrated model.

This model doesn't predict high values due to the low prevalence of
smoking within the population. The highest likelihood our model predicts
is 63.75\% All results should be interpreted with the population average
in mind, which is \textasciitilde16.5\%. For example, if the model
predicts the likelihood of an individual being a smoker at 33\%, said
individual is twice as more likely to be a smoker than the average. This
effect can be seen in the following calibration chart.

\end{figure}

For interpretability, we decided to include a forest plot of the odds
ratio for each variable in our model, as the log-odds can be difficult
to interpret. The intercept 0.257 can be interpreted as the probability
of a white, non-married, unqualified male living in urban area being a
smoker, using the reference levels of each factor. On average, the blue
factors increase the probability and the red factors decrease the
probability. Being Black, Asian, Married or a female significantly
decreases this probability, so this is evidence of a socioeconomic
effect.

\subsubsection{Which lifestyle habits are associated with systolic blood
pressure?}\label{which-lifestyle-habits-are-associated-with-systolic-blood-pressure}}

We chose to model the systolic blood pressure (BP) using the
Inverse-Normal distribution with a \(1/\mu_i^2\) link function. This
distribution was a suitable choice because this variable has a lot of
outliers, is right-skewed and strictly positive. We also tested a
Log-Normal distribution, a Normal distribution with identity link and a
Gamma distribution with an inverse link but found that the
Inverse-Normal distribution was best able to account for the higher
values of BP in the Q-Q plots. The data we used to fit this model was
the same training data set as the Binomial model. We filtered out
\emph{NA} values of BMI and BP as we only want to consider respondents
that had lab measurements taken, leaving us with 2960 observations.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{Coursework_files/figure-latex/output-relationship-plots-1} \caption{Relationship of BMI and Age with Mean Systolic Blood Pressure}\label{fig:output-relationship-plots}
\end{figure}

We studied the relationship between both age and BMI with BP, shown in
Figure \ref{fig:output-relationship-plots}. There was a quadratic
relationship between BMI and BP so we decided to include a quadratic
term in our model. To account for possible dependencies between
variables, we tried fitting models with different interaction terms and
found three that were significant. These were between BMI \& Age
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AgeBMI}{Medicine 2017}), BMI \& gender
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-SexBMI}{K. et al. 2019}) and Age \& Sex
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AgeSex}{M. et al. 2019}), which are supported by
previous research.

To determine the predictors in the final model, we used a stepwise
approach starting with the full model and eliminating variables based on
AIC. The final model selected was

\(\eta_{ijklm} \sim cig_{ij} + a_i + ms_{ik} + u_{il} + bmi_i + bmi_i^2 + s_{im} + n_i^{alc} + \gamma_{im}^{bmi:s}bmi_i + \gamma_{im}^{a:s}a_i + \alpha_i^{a:bmi}\)\$

omsysval \textasciitilde{} cigsta3\_19 + age\_estim + marstatD +
urban14b + BMIVal + I(BMIVal \^{} 2) + Sex + d7many3\_19 + BMIVal:Sex +
age\_estim:Sex + BMIVal:age\_estim

The Q-Q plot in Figure \ref{fig:output-qq-plot} shows a good fit to the
distribution and, despite some deviation at both ends of the scale, the
model captured the outliers more accurately than other distributions we
tried. On our testing dataset we achieved a RMSE of 14.3mmHg, which was
relatively small compared to the threshold for hypertensive crisis of
140mmHg+.

We found that, on average, young females are predicted lower blood
pressure than young men but as they age, their blood pressure increases
at a faster rate. Controlling for other lifestyle choices included in
the model, a female's blood pressure can be expected to exceed an
equivalent male's at around 72 years old. Figure
\ref{fig:output-effect-plots-age} shows this relationship. One of the
biggest influences on BP was smoking status, and we found smoking was
associated with higher blood pressure for both males and females, also
shown in Figure \ref{fig:output-effect-plots}. This effect is largest
for males and a typical male can expect a 1.69\% increase in BP by
taking up smoking.

\end{figure}

Drinking was also related to higher BP, and we observed a linear
relationship in Figure \ref{fig:output-effect-plots-alc} with the number
of days that alcohol was consumed in the previous week. On average, one
extra day of drinking led to an increase of 0.74 mmHg.

\begin{figure}[H]

\subsection{Results/Conclusion}\label{resultsconclusion}}

Our analysis showed that alcohol consumption is highly common in our
sample, with approximately 80.4\% being consumers, while smoking and
vaping rates were lower at 16.5\% and 4.3\%, respectively. Older males
showed the highest tendencies for alcohol consumption, with `frequent'
drinking the most prevalent among males aged 65-74. Unlike `frequent'
alcohol consumption, the prevalence of smoking decreases with age.
Individuals aged 16-24 appear to be the most susceptible to smoking
cigarettes, indicating a significant issue within youth culture.
Moreover, we found interesting, opposing associations between
deprivation levels and smoking and drinking behaviours. Smoking
prevalence seemed to increase as deprivation levels decreased, whereas
alcohol consumption appeared to do the opposite.

To help us uncover the underlying socio-economic factors that may drive
the prevalence of smoking, we looked at the most `comparable' respondent
type in our dataset. This `respondent' is a white, single male who has
no qualifications and lives in an urban area. We found that the
probability of our hypothetical respondent being a smoker is
approximately 25\%, which can be seen from Figure
\ref{fig:output-forest-plot}. This is notably higher than the population
average of 16.5. The smoking prevalence estimate in our sample is
significantly higher than that of the population of interest (16.5\%
vs.~13.9\%, outside of the CI in Table
\ref{tab:output-estimates-table}). The only socio-economic variables to
certainly increase this probability is the deprivation level our
respondent falls under. The rest of the socio-economic variables we have
access to, appear to decrease the likelihood of smoking. For example, if
our respondent is any of the following: Asian, black, married, or went
on to further education, the chances of them being a smoker is at-least
halved.

If we had more observations from current smokers, we may have been able
to increase the positive predictive value of our final model for smoking
status, and hence obtain increased accuracy. Due to the cross-sectional
format of the study, we are unable to comment on temporal changes in
smoking habits or establish a causal relationship. Furthermore, access
to data from the whole of the UK could improve generalisability, but
including participants with hypertensive crisis helps to generalise our
findings to those who may need the most attention and preventative care
from healthcare providers.
