## Marking Scheme

The project will be marked out of 50. There is no single correct analysis for this type of project, so you
will not be marked on the basis of how close you get to some particular model answer. The marks are not
4
subdivided, but will be allocated on a combination of statistical approach and justification, interpretation
of results in context and presentation.
35 - 50 (First)
A report that could be presented with little or no revision. Analysis is sound so that conclusions are
well-supported statistically. Interpretation is reasonably mature. The project should demonstrate a clear
overview of the work, without getting lost in details, and be free of all but minor statistical errors.
30 - 34 (2.1)
A report that could be presented after a round of revision, but without having to re-do much of the actual
analysis. Some flaws in the analysis or presentation (or minor flaws in both), but basically sound. A good
grasp of the statistics and context, so that interpretation is reasonable.
25 - 29 (2.2)
Major re-working required before the report could be presented, but containing some sound statistics demonstrating understanding of statistical modelling and its application. Reasonable presentation and organisation.
20 - 24 (Third)
Major flaws in analysis and presentation, but demonstrating some understanding of statistics, and a reasonable attempt to present the results.
0 - 19 (Fail)
Flawed analysis demonstrating little or no understanding of statistics, and/or incomprehensible or overly
bad organisation/presentation.
